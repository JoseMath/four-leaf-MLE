* Idea for the april paper
Implement 2 versions of the maximizer. One which checks all submodels. The other which checks only those needed,
according to Rhodes and Zwiernick's latent class model paper. We can verify whether this is really all we need.
* make a felsenstein zone picture
* finish adding likelihoods
* carefully check the parts of the program
* make a final MLE function
* turn it into a module
* Tiebreaking
- report if tiebreaking results in different Felsenstein plots
  
* TODO
- [ ] Add functionality to test branch length consistency for all submodels
- [ ]
